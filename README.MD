# Taipy Test

This is a very minimal app using Taipy to test it.

For now, I have just tested Taipy GUI.

* main.py calls dashboard_fossil_fuels_consumption.py
* hello_taipy.py is just a hello world app with taipy

The dashboard app only has a selector for Countries or regions of the world. Data about fossil fuel consumption, per capita, will be shown as a plot and in a table, for the selected country or region.
